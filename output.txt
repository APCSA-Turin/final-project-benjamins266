But, contrary to its serene appearance, the clouded globe of Venus is a world of intense heat, crushing atmospheric pressure and clouds of corrosive acid.  This newly processed image revisits the original data with modern image processing software. A contrast-enhanced version of this view, also provided here, makes features in the planet's thick cloud cover visible in greater detail.  The clouds seen here are located about 40 miles (60 kilometers) above the planet's surface, at altitudes where Earth-like atmospheric pressures and temperatures exist. They are comprised of sulfuric acid particles, as opposed to water droplets or ice crystals, as on Earth. These cloud particles are mostly white in appearance; however, patches of red-tinted clouds also can be seen. This is due to the presence of a mysterious material that absorbs light at blue and ultraviolet wavelengths. Many chemicals have been suggested for this mystery component, from sulfur compounds to even biological materials, but a consensus has yet to be reached among researchers.  The clouds of Venus whip around the planet at nearly over 200 miles per hour (100 meters per second), circling the globe in about four and a half days. That these hurricane-force winds cover nearly the entire planet is another unexplained mystery, especially given that the solid planet itself rotates at a very slow 4 mph (less than 2 meters per second) — much slower than Earth's rotation rate of about 1,000 mph (450 meters per second).  The winds and clouds also blow to the west, not to the east as on the Earth. This is because the planet itself rotates to the west, backward compared to Earth and most of the other planets. As the clouds travel westward, they also typically progress toward the poles; this can be seen in the Mariner 10 view as a curved spiral pattern at mid latitudes. Near the equator, instead of long streaks, areas of more clumpy, discrete clouds can be seen, indicating enhanced upwelling and cloud formation in the equatorial region, spurred on by the enhanced power of sunlight there.  This view is a false color composite created by combining images taken using orange and ultraviolet spectral filters on the spacecraft's imaging camera. These were used for the red and blue channels of the color image, respectively, with the green channel synthesized by combining the other two images.  Flying past Venus en route to the first-ever flyby of Mercury, Mariner 10 became the first spacecraft to use a gravity assist to change its flight path in order to reach another planet. The images used to create this view were acquired by Mariner 10 on Feb. 7 and 8, 1974, a couple of days after the spacecraft's closest approach to Venus on Feb. 5.  Despite their many differences, comparisons between Earth and Venus are valuable for helping to understand their distinct climate histories. Nearly 50 years after this view was obtained, many fundamental questions about Venus remain unanswered. Did Venus have oceans long ago? How has its atmosphere evolved over time, and when did its runaway greenhouse effect begin? How does Venus lose its heat? How volcanically and tectonically active has Venus been over the last billion years?  This image was processed from archived Mariner 10 data by JPL engineer Kevin M. Gill.  The Mariner 10 mission was managed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.  https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA23791","description_508":"As it sped away from Venus, NASA's Mariner 10 spacecraft captured this seemingly peaceful view of a planet the size of Earth, wrapped in a dense, global cloud layer.","keywords":["Mariner 10","Venus"],"media_type":"image","nasa_id":"PIA23791","secondary_creator":"NASA/JPL-Caltech","title":"Venus from Mariner 10"}],"links":[{"href":"https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/PIA23791/PIA23791~small.jpg","rel":"alternate","render":"image","width":640,"size":14000,"height":312},{"href":"https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/PIA23791/PIA23791~thumb.jpg","rel":"preview","render":"image","width":640,"size":14000,"height":312},{"href":"https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/PIA23791/PIA23791~orig.jpg","rel":"canonical","render":"image","height":1096,"width":2245,"size":92000}]},{"href":"https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/PIA00083/collection.json","data":[{"center":"JPL","date_created":"1996-02-07T15:02:40Z","description":"Many of the impact craters of Venus revealed by NASA Magellan spacecraft have characteristics unlike craters on any other planetary body.

With a diameter of 11 kilometers (6.8 miles) it is one of the smaller craters on Venus. Because many small meteoroids disintegrate during their passage through the dense atmosphere, there is an absence of craters smaller than 3 kilometers (1.9 miles) in diameter, and even craters smaller than 25 kilometers (15.5 miles) are relatively scarce. The apron of ejected material suggests that the impacting body made contact with the surface from an oblique angle. Upon closer observation it is possible to delineate secondary craters, impact scars from blocks ejected from the primary crater. A feature associated with this and many other Venusian craters is a radar-dark halo. Since dark radar return signifies a smooth surface, it has been hypothesized that an intense shock wave removed or pulverized previously rough surface material or that a blanket of fine material was deposited during or after the impact.   http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA00475","description_508":"This image from NASA Magellan spacecraft is of Crater Stephania in northern Sedna Planitia on Venus.

Coronae are large circular or oval structures first identified in Soviet radar images of Venus.

A portion of Onatah Corona, over 350 kilometers (210 miles) in diameter, can be seen on the right of the mosaic. Both features are surrounded by a ring of ridges and troughs, which in places cut more radially-oriented fractures. The centers of the features also contain radial fractures as well as volcanic domes and flows. Coronae are thought to form due to the upwelling of hot material from deep in the interior of Venus. The two coronae may have formed at the same time over a single upwelling, or may indicate movement of the upwelling or the upper layers of the planet to the west over time. A 'pancake' dome, similar to low-relief domes see in the southern hemisphere, is located just to the southwest of Bahet.

Based on data from the Pioneer Venus Orbiter and the ground-based Arecibo Radar Observatory, it is known that this region is located on the low rise that separates Sedna Planitia and Guinevere Planitia, just to the west of Eistla Regio. Two sets of parallel lineations are seen intersecting almost at right angles. The fainter lineations are spaced at regular intervals of about one kilometer (0.6 mile) and extend beyond the boundary of the image. The width of the faint lineations is at the limit of resolution of the best Magellan images. The brighter, more dominant lineations are less regular and, in places, appear to begin and end where they intersect the fainter lineations. It is not clear whether the two sets of lineations are faults or fractures, but in other Magellan images, these bright lineations are associated with pit craters and volcanic features. This type of terrain has not been seen on Venus nor on other planets.

Due to the dense Venusian atmosphere, primary impact craters of less than a 3 kilometer (2 mile) diameter are nonexistent. The dark circular region and associated central bright feature in this image are thought to be the remnants of a meteoroid smaller than the size necessary to create an impact crater entering the atmosphere at a low velocity (approximately 350 meters/second.) The central bright feature appears to be a cluster of small secondary impacts, ejecta and debris from the original meteor that broke up in the atmosphere. Even though most of the meteorite did not hit the surface, the atmospheric shock wave could be great enough to modify the surrounding region. One explanation for this radar dark circular formation, called dark margins, could be that the shock wave was energetic enough to pulverize the surface (smooth surfaces generally appear radar dark.) Another explanation is that the surface could be blanketed by a fine material that was formed by the original meteor's breakup through the atmosphere. More than half of the impact craters on Venus have associated dark margins, and most of these are prominently located left of center of the crater. This is another effect which could be caused by the dense atmosphere of Venus.   http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA00477","description_508":"This full resolution mosaiced image from NASA Magellan spacecraft is located in the Lakshmi region of Venus at 47 degrees north latitude and 334 east longitude.","keywords":["Venus","Magellan"],"media_type":"image","nasa_id":"PIA00477","secondary_creator":"NASA/JPL","title":"Venus - Possible Remnants of a Meteoroid in Lakshmi Region"}],"links":[{"href":"https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/PIA00477/PIA00477~medium.jpg","rel":"alternate","render":"image","width":1280,"size":626000,"height":1091},{"href":"https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/PIA00477/PIA00477~small.jpg","rel":"alternate","render":"image","width":640,"size":139000,"height":545},{"href":"https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/PIA00477/PIA00477~thumb.jpg","rel":"preview","render":"image","width":640,"size":139000,"height":545},{"href":"https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/PIA00477/PIA00477~orig.jpg","rel":"canonical","render":"image","height":1392,"width":1633,"size":1018000}]},{"href":"https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/PIA00149/collection.json","data":[{"center":"JPL","date_created":"1996-02-05T13:06:14Z","description":"NASA's Magellan full-resolution image shows Maxwell Montes, centered at 65 degrees north latitude and 6 degrees east longitude.

It is the first -- and may be the only -- time that we will ever see our solar system from such a vantage point. The image is a portion of a wide-angle image containing the sun and the region of space where the Earth and Venus were at the time with two narrow-angle pictures centered on each planet. The wide-angle was taken with the camera's darkest filter (a methane absorption band), and the shortest possible exposure (5 thousandths of a second) to avoid saturating the camera's vidicon tube with scattered sunlight. The sun is not large in the sky as seen from Voyager's perspective at the edge of the solar system but is still eight million times brighter than the brightest star in Earth's sky, Sirius. The image of the sun you see is far larger than the actual dimension of the solar disk. The result of the brightness is a bright burned out image with multiple reflections from the optics in the camera. The \"rays\" around the sun are a diffraction pattern of the calibration lamp which is mounted in front of the wide angle lens. The two narrow-angle frames containing the images of the Earth and Venus have been digitally mosaiced into the wide-angle image at the appropriate scale. These images were taken through three color filters and recombined to produce a color image. The violet, green and blue filters were used; exposure times were, for the Earth image, 0.72, 0.48 and 0.72 seconds, and for the Venus frame, 0.36, 0.24 and 0.36, respectively. Although the planetary pictures were taken with the narrow-angle camera (1500 mm focal length) and were not pointed directly at the sun, they show the effects of the glare from the nearby sun, in the form of long linear streaks resulting from the scattering of sunlight off parts of the camera and its sun shade. From Voyager's great distance both Earth and Venus are mere points of light, less than the size of a picture element even in the narrow-angle camera. Earth was a crescent only 0.12 pixel in size. Coincidentally, Earth lies right in the center of one of the scattered light rays resulting from taking the image so close to the sun. Detailed analysis also suggests that Voyager detected the moon as well, but it is too faint to be seen without special processing. Venus was only 0.11 pixel in diameter. The faint colored structure in both planetary frames results from sunlight scattered in the optics.   http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA00450","description_508":"This color image of the sun, Earth and Venus was taken by the Voyager 1 spacecraft Feb. 14, 1990, when it was approximately 32 degrees above the plane of the ecliptic and at a slant-range distance of approximately 4 billion miles.","keywords":["Sun","Voyager","Earth","Venus"],"media_type":"image","nasa_id":"PIA00450","secondary_creator":"NASA/JPL","title":"Solar System Portrait - View of the Sun, Earth and Venus"}],"links":[{"href":"https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/PIA00450/PIA00450~medium.jpg","rel":"alternate","render":"image","width":1280,"size":119000,"height":988},{"href":"https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/PIA00450/PIA00450~small.jpg","rel":"alternate","render":"image","width":640,"size":37000,"height":494},{"href":"https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/PIA00450/PIA00450~thumb.jpg","rel":"preview","render":"image","width":640,"size":37000,"height":494},{"href":"https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/PIA00450/PIA00450~large.jpg","rel":"alternate","render":"image","width":1920,"size":218000,"height":1483},{"href":"https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/PIA00450/PIA00450~orig.jpg","rel":"canonical","render":"image","height":2650,"width":3430,"size":509000}]},{"href":"https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/PIA00465/collection.json","data":[{"center":"JPL","date_created":"1996-09-26T10:20:54Z","description":"These radar images show an identical area on Venus (centered at 110 degrees longitude and 64 degrees north latitude) as imaged by the U.S. NASA Magellan spacecraft in 1991 (left) and the U.S.S.R.

Differences in apparent shading in the images are due to differences in the two radar imaging systems. Prior to Magellan, the Venera 15/16 data was the best available for scientists studying Venus. Much greater detail is visible in the Magellan image owing to the greater resolution of the Magellan radar system. In the area seen here, approximately 200 small volcanoes, ranging in diameter from 2 to 12 kilometers (1.2 to 7.4 miles) can be identified. These volcanoes were first identified as small hills in Venera 15/16 images and were predicted to be shield-type volcanoes constructed mainly from eruptions of fluid lava flows similar to those that produce the Hawaiian Islands and sea floor volcanoes - a prediction that was confirmed by Magellan. These small shield-type volcanoes are the most abundant geologic feature on the surface of Venus, believed to number in the hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, and are important evidence in understanding the geologic evolution of the planet. The only other planet in our Solar System with this large number of volcanoes is Earth. Clearly visible in the Magellan image are details of volcano morphology, such as variation in slope, the occurrence and size range of summit craters, and geologic age relationships between adjacent volcanoes, as well as additional volcanoes that were not identifiable in the Venera image.   http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA00465","description_508":"These radar images show an identical area on Venus (centered at 110 degrees longitude and 64 degrees north latitude) as imaged by the U.S. NASA Magellan spacecraft in 1991 (left) and the U.S.S.R.

Volcanic vent areas in this part of the plains west of Alpha Regio consist of domes and pits up to nearly 3 kilometers across. Extending eastward these features are sinuous channels, most of which are about 10 kilometers or more long. The channels narrow away from the pits and for most of their lengths are about 1 kilometer in diameter. The nearest planetary analogues for these features are sinuous rilles on the moon. These have been explained as lava channels and/or the result of lava erosion. On Earth lava channels form by downhill drainage of a lava flow leaving a channel behind. Lava may continue to flow in the channel once it has formed. However, lava channels on Earth are normally only a few meters or tens of meters wide. On the other hand, they may be the result of lava erosion. This is a process that only normally occurs to a limited extent on Earth because melting is inhibited by the cool upper layers of the planet. Also, lavas rarely flow turbulently enough to cause mechanical erosion. On Venus the surface materials are already at high temperatures, thus assisting thermal erosion and it is possible that lavas which may flow turbulently are more readily available than on Earth. Resolution of the Magellan data is about 120 meters (400 feet).   http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA00467","description_508":"This image from NASA Magellan spacecraft is in the Lavinia Region of Venus.
